PCI DSS Requirement 12.9 applies only if the entity being assessed is a service provider.  Merchants and other entities that use service providers should review PCI DSS Requirement 12.8 and its sub-requirements, as this is where the controls for managing service provider relationships are defined.  Requirement 12.9 provides a corresponding control for service providers to support their customers' need to meet Requirement 12.8.2. <br/><br/>Requirement 12.9 therefore does not apply to merchants, and should be marked "N/A" for a merchant's PCI DSS assessment.
