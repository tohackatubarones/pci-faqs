The PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) maintains lists of qualified assessors and has implemented a quality assurance program to ensure that services provided by qualified assessors are of an appropriate level. Completion of in-depth training programs and annual re-certifications is required for security companies seeking to become qualified assessors.
