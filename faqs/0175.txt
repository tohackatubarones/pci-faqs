Systems that store, process, or transmit only truncated PANs (where a segment of PAN data has been permanently removed) may be considered out of scope for PCI DSS if those systems are adequately segmented from the cardholder data environment, and do not otherwise store, process, or transmit cardholder data or sensitive authentication data. This applies to any truncation that meets the acceptable PAN truncation formats specified in FAQ 1091. <br/>
<br/>

However, the system performing the truncation of the PANs, as well as any connected systems and networks, would be in scope for PCI DSS.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: black">Some entities use solutions that combine truncation with tokenization or encryption to create format-preserving values that can be passed through legacy payment systems. For example, the BIN and the last four digits of the PAN are retained in accordance with FAQ 1091 while the remaining digits are replaced with values generated via a tokenization or encryption operation. Whether such format-preserving values may be considered out of scope for PCI DSS is dependent on a variety of factors and can only be determined in respect of an entity's <span style="color: black">specific<span style="color: black"> implementation by an Assessor.
