For information about protecting different elements of cardholder data (CHD), please refer to the tables provided in the "PCI DSS Applicability Information" section in the PCI DSS. Â The tables illustrates that, if cardholder name, service code, and/or expiration date are stored, processed or transmitted with the PAN, or are otherwise present in the cardholder data environment, they must be protected in accordance with applicable PCI DSS requirements.<br/><br/>This means that all applicable PCI DSS requirements, such as firewalls, patches, anti-virus, access controls, policies and procedures, etc., must be applied for protection of those cardholder data elements. However, only the PAN itself must be rendered unreadable in accordance with Requirement 3.4.<br/><br/>If these other elements of cardholder data (that is, cardholder name, expiry date and/or service code) are present without any PAN, then PCI DSS would not apply to those elements.
