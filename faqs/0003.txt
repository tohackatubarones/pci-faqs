<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif">If the TPSP undergoes its own PCI DSS assessment, it is expected to provide sufficient evidence to its customers to verify that the scope of the TPSP's PCI DSS assessment covered the services applicable to the customer, and that the relevant PCI DSS requirements were examined and determined to be in place. If the TPSP has a PCI DSS Attestation of Compliance (AOC), it is expected to provide the AOC to customers upon request. This AOC should be applicable to the services the TPSP provides to the customer(s) and provide evidence that the PCI DSS requirements relevant to those services are met. The customer may also request relevant sections of the TPSP's PCI DSS Report on Compliance (ROC) or Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) D for Service Providers.
