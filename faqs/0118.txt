PCI DSS defines a number of events and system types that require daily log reviews, and allows the organization to determine the log review frequency for all other in-scope events and systems that do not fall into those categories.<br/><br/>For some environments, it is possible that all in-scope systems fall under the system categories defined in Requirement 10.6.1, meaning that daily log reviews are required for all in-scope systems. In other environments, there may be many different types of system that are considered in scope, but which are not critical systems and neither store, process or transmit CHD nor provide security services to the CDE. Some possible examples could be stock-control or inventory-control systems, print servers (assuming there is no printing of CHD) or certain types of workstations. For these events or systems, the entity, as part of its annual risk assessment process, is expected to define the frequency for log reviews based on the risk to its specific environment.Â
