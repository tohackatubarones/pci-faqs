Overall ATM requirements are not currently included in the PTS program so there is no cause for action in this regard. The Encrypting PIN Pad category will still feature in the program, which does impact ATMs. However there is currently no material change to testing procedures or website listings.<br/><br/>Beginning in version 3 of the POI requirements, the security requirements were enhanced to include modules for the Secure Reading and Exchange of Data and for Open Protocols.  In version 4, while the security requirements did not significantly change, the underlying testing procedures are much more robust in both what the testing laboratory must do to validate device compliance, and in what support the vendor must provide to support that testing.
