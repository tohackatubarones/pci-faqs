Compliance validation programs are managed by the individual payment brands, not by the PCI Security Standards Council. Payment brand validation programs may include whether certain applications must be PA-DSS validated, under what conditions non-PA-DSS applications may be used, timeframes for mandatory use of PA-DSS applications, reporting requirements, due dates, fines and penalties, etc. For information about individual payment brand compliance programs, please contact your acquirer (merchant bank) or the payment brands directly.Â <br/><br/>Questions related to new installations of a payment application listed as 'acceptable only for pre-existing deployments', including how onboarding or transferring of merchant accounts may affect use of these applications, should be addressed to the acquirer and/or applicable payment brand
