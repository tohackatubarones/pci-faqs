However, how long an assessment result is valid and how frequently an entity must be reassessed is determined by organizations that manage compliance programs (for example, payment brands and acquirers).<br/>
<br/>
Entities should always contact their acquirer or the payment brands directly for information about their compliance programs and reporting requirements.

There are no specific rules in PCI DSS regarding how long CHD or SAD can be stored prior to authorization, but such data would need to be protected according to PCI DSS.  Use of PTS-validated payment devices and PA-DSS validated payment applications can support PCI DSS compliance for the protection of data prior to authorization.<br/><br/>With respect to SAD, PCI DSS Requirement 3.2 prohibits storage of SAD AFTER authorization, even if encrypted. Whether SAD is permitted to be stored prior to authorization is determined by the individual payment brands, including any related usage and protection requirements. Additionally, several payment brands have very specific rules that prohibit any storage of SAD and do not make any exceptions. To determine payment brand requirements, please contact the individual payment brands directly. Contact information for the payment brands can be found in FAQ 1142."

If unforeseen circumstances occur that impact an entity's ability to complete scheduled scans, every effort should be made to perform scans as soon as possible (for example, within a day or two) of the scheduled scan date.

Where the assessor is unable to complete testing of a requirement because of a legal constraint-for example, due to government enforced travel restrictions, local or regional lockdowns, or other factors impacting the assessor's ability to gain access or complete a testing activity-the affected requirements must be marked as 'Not Tested'.  Because the assessor was unable to determine whether the requirement has been met, Part 3 of the AOC must be marked as 'Non-Compliant.'<br/>

https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/faq/articles/Frequently_Asked_Question/does-pci-dss-define-which-versions-of-tls-must-be-used/,Does PCI DSS define which versions of TLS must be used?,"No.  However, PCI DSS does not consider SSL or early TLS to be strong cryptography.<br/>
<br/>
Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a protocol that encrypts traffic between two endpoints to provide privacy and reliability of transmitted data and is widely used for internet communications and online transactions. Current available versions of TLS include TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.2, and TLS 1.3. PCI DSS does not allow the use of SSL or early TLS as a security control, with one exception. For allowed uses of early TLS, see the PCI SSC <i>Information Supplement, Use of SSL /Early TLS for POS POI Terminal Connections</i>.<br/>
<br/>
The term ""early TLS"" does not refer to a specific version(s) of the protocol, but rather it encompasses any version or implementation of TLS that is vulnerable to a known exploit. This categorization is intended to help entities identify and prioritize mitigation efforts for TLS implementations known to be inherently vulnerable. Entities should have processes to monitor threats as they continue to evolve and as new versions of the protocol are released to address those threats, and to keep the entity's cryptographic implementations up to date to prevent them becoming vulnerable to known exploits.<br/>
<br/>
All cryptographic implementations, including TLS, must use and support modern cryptographic algorithms, secure configuration settings, and other features as needed to meet the intent of strong cryptography. This means that every TLS implementation, irrespective of the protocol version, must apply strong cryptography using an appropriate cipher suite to implement a secure key exchange algorithm, strong cryptography, and an appropriate message authentication for strong cryptography and security protocols.<br/>
<br/>
Entities using TLS should review their implementations against industry references (such as the current version of NIST SP 800-52) for guidance on configuration options that meet the intent of strong cryptography. Note that, while industry guidelines such as NIST SP 800-52 may provide additional insight into specific configurations and implementations and provide the rationale for implementing particular controls, PCI DSS does not mandate the use of external standards or guidance in meeting strong cryptography. In addition to monitoring specific threats to cryptographic implementations, entities should monitor changes in industry best practices and standards, and where applicable, entities should apply modifications to minimum cryptographic standards used within their environments to ensure that sensitive information such as account data and authentication credentials remain secured.<br/>
<br/>
It is expected that systems conducting negotiation of TLS protocols use the strongest cipher suites first, with subsequent negotiation to mutually supported cipher suites only if needed, but always within the bounds of the minimum standard of strong cryptography and security protocols.<br/>
<br/>
For the definition of ""strong cryptography"" as used in PCI DSS, refer to the PCI DSS and PA-DSS Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms available in PCI SSC's Document Library, under the PCI DSS drop-down menu. "
https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/faq/articles/Frequently_Asked_Question/can-vlans-be-used-for-network-segmentation/,Can VLANS be used for network segmentation?,"In general, implementing adequate network segmentation can reduce the scope of the PCI DSS assessment if it isolates systems that store, process, or transmit cardholder data from other systems. While this segmentation can be implemented with, for example, properly-configured internal firewalls, routers with strong access control lists, VLANs, or other technologies that restrict access to a particular network segment, the PCI Security Standards Council is not able to offer an opinion about how your organization can achieve adequate network segmentation since it requires an understanding of security features and controls implemented in your environment.

https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/faq/articles/Frequently_Asked_Question/are-applications-listed-as-acceptable-only-for-pre-existing-deployments-able-to-meet-the-current-pa-dss-and-pci-dss/,Are applications listed as Acceptable only for Pre-existing Deployments able to meet the current PA-DSS and PCI DSS?,"Payment applications that are listed as Acceptable only for Pre-existing Deployments have previously been validated as meeting PA-DSS but the validation is no longer current. This may be due to the validation being to an expired version of PA-DSS, or because the application vendor has chosen to or does not meet the annual revalidation requirements. <br/>
<br/>
Applications listed as Acceptable only for Pre-existing Deployments could still be capable of meeting the current version of PA-DSS; however, this is not assured and should not be assumed. If a previously-validated payment application no longer meets the current version of PA-DSS, it is also likely that it can't meet the current version of PCI DSS, and entities using the application may need to implement additional security controls as part of their PCI DSS implementation.  As an example; an application validated to PA-DSS v2.0 could be transmitting cardholder data using an encryption protocol that is no longer considered strong cryptography.   In this scenario, the application would not meet the current version of PA-DSS and would not be sufficient to meet PCI DSS Requirement 4.1.  Entities using the application will need to implement additional and/or alternative controls to secure any cardholder data sent by the application over public or untrusted networks.<br/>
<br/>
Entities using PA-DSS validated payment applications should be familiar with the Implementation Guide provided by the vendor for their application.  The Implementation Guide contains information about the application's configuration and security settings, and also identifies which protocols are used by the application. This information may help the entity determine whether the application continues to meet their security needs and whether it supports the current version of PCI DSS.<br/>
<br/>
If the application no longer meets current PA-DSS requirements, but is still supported by the vendor, entities are encouraged to contact the vendor to determine if an update is available. <br/>

In the last three years, the industry has seen two types of attacks against merchant websites which do not directly process cardholder data but which work in conjunction with a payment service provider. Typically these merchants completed SAQ A as they believed that all their payment processing was outsourced. Because of the nature of the attacks, the payment card brands and PCI SSC have clarified the conditions where a merchant can legitimately consider processing to be outsourced.<br/>
<br/>
To be eligible for PCI DSS v3 SAQ-A, the e-commerce environment must be fully outsourced such that: ""The entirety of all payment pages delivered to the consumer's browser originates directly from a third-party PCI DSS validated service provider(s).""  A merchant website can either redirect the consumer to a third-party payment page, or embed the third-party payment page in an iFrame. In either method, the main attack a criminal has against this is to change the code on the merchant's website so the consumer is re-directed to the criminal's payment page and not the legitimate payment page — this is commonly known as a ""man-in-the-middle"" (MITM) attack. The disadvantage for the criminal is that this attack is usually detected reasonably quickly and minimal cardholder data is put at risk. Additionally some payment service providers are developing solutions that help to detect when a MITM attack has occurred and to notify the merchant accordingly.<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, there are a number of e-commerce acceptance methods where the merchant website generates the payment page used to collect cardholder data before posting it directly from the consumers' browser to the payment processor.  The form elements on this page may be created by HTML loaded from the merchant's website or by JavaScript loaded by the consumer's browser from a third party. From the merchant's perspective this is an attractive solution as it gives the merchant greater control over the look-and-feel of the payment page and the payment flow than what is provided in a redirect or iFrame method.  The common criminal attack against this scenario is to compromise the payment page by including criminal-provided JavaScript that simply takes a copy of the cardholder data as it is being entered and sends it to a criminal's server. The actual payment flow is not affected, and therefore this attack is very hard to detect and will often provide an ongoing supply of cardholder data to the criminal. It is primarily for these types of environments that the Council developed SAQ A-EP to provide a level of assurance that the merchant's website was appropriately protected. <br/>
<br/>
The Council understands that the various ways that merchants can make e-commerce transactions is continually evolving. Merchants and QSAs receive often conflicting advice from vendors which can be especially confusing when the difference between using an iFrame and embedding a payment form in a &lt;DIV&gt; appears to be minimal. However, the difference in security is substantial: fully-hosted payment pages and payment pages loaded into an iFrame are resistant to the transparent theft of cardholder data as it is entered by the consumer; techniques such as Direct Post and JavaScript forms are not. The Council is aware that a MITM attack against a redirect or iFrame is viable, but in the payment brands' experience these are detected before significant volumes of cardholder data are lost. The Council is working with Payment Service Providers to encourage tamper-resistance and tamper-detection which will also reduce the viability of a MITM-type attack.<br/>
<br/>
Where merchants or QSAs are unsure whether the correct SAQ to be completed is SAQ A or SAQ A-EP, they are advised to firstly determine whether ""The entirety of all payment pages delivered to the consumer's browser originates directly from a third-party PCI DSS validated service provider(s)"".  If any element of a payment page originates from the merchant's website, the implementation is not eligible for SAQ A. If any element of a payment page originates from a non-compliant service provider, the implementation is not eligible for either SAQ A or SAQ A-EP.  If it is unclear whether this condition has been met, merchants or QSAs are advised to contact the acquirer or payment brand."

However, while it may be possible for a PCI POI device to implement all the necessary functionality for use in a P2PE solution solely within its existing PTS-approved firmware, generally the POI device will contain additional software. Any software (whether it has access to cardholder data or not) that is present or intended to be present on the POI device within the P2PE solution that was not included in the PTS-evaluation and approval of the POI device's firmware must be assessed in accordance with the PCI P2PE Standard. Note that it may be possible for additional (non-firmware) software to be present on the POI device during its PTS assessment. However, any software that does not meet the PTS POI definition of firmware is not reviewed as part of the PTS POI assessment or included in the PTS approval. The assessor must be diligent in identifying any non-firmware on the POI device(s).

This means the application, when properly installed and configured, is capable of supporting the merchant's PCI DSS compliance.  <br/> <br/>	Using a PA-DSS validated application does not reduce the scope of a merchant's cardholder data environment, nor does it guarantee PCI DSS compliance. The boundaries of the cardholder data environment are not affected by the presence or absence of a PA-DSS validated payment application, and payment applications are in scope for a merchant's PCI DSS assessment. During the PCI DSS assessment, the assessor must verify that the application is implemented and configured in a PCI DSS compliant manner.  The PA-DSS Implementation Guide, provided by the application vendor for each PA-DSS validated application, is a valuable tool for the PCI DSS assessor to understand how the application is implemented and whether it is configured correctly.<br/> <br/>	Additionally, it should be noted that some payment brand rules may require the use of PA-DSS applications. Merchants should contact their acquirer or the payment brands directly, as applicable, to determine if they have any requirements.

The consumer's environment in which the software runs is not in scope for the organization's PCI DSS assessment.<br/>
 <br/>
Even though the consumer's environment is outside of the organization's PCI DSS scope, the development of the software is in scope, as the software is being developed for the purpose of facilitating a merchant's payment acceptance process. The software should therefore be developed in accordance with industry best practices and applicable PCI DSS requirements — for example, those included in Requirement 6. Additionally, if the software developer stores, processes, or transmits payment account data on the consumer's behalf, then PCI DSS will apply to the developer's environment. <br/>
 <br/>
It is recommended that software be developed using the Software Security Framework (SSF) standards (the Secure Software Standard and Secure SLC Standard) as a baseline for the protection of payment account data. Sources of industry guidance for developing mobile applications include ENISA and OWASP, as well as the PCI Mobile Payment Acceptance Security Guidelines for Developers.<br/>

For information about whether software that runs on a consumer's device is eligible for listing as Validated Payment Software according to the PCI Secure Software Standard, or whether the software vendors are eligible for listing as a Secure SLC-Qualified Vendor according to the PCI Secure SLC Standard, refer to the Secure Software Program Guide or the Secure SLC Program Guide, respectively, on the PCI SSC website.<br/>
<br/>
Note that, while PCI DSS does not require the use of Validated Payment Software or a Secure SLC-Qualified Vendor, some payment brands may have specific requirements. Entities should contact organizations that manage compliance programs, such as their acquirer (merchant bank) the payment brands, or other entity directly for information about any such requirements.

<br/>
If a merchant outsources all their payment operations, the applicable PCI DSS requirements for the protection of account data would apply to the environment(s) where the data is actually stored, processed and transmitted, such as third party service providers, payment gateways, etc. However, it is the responsibility of the merchant to ensure that the data they share with third parties is properly handled and protected - just because a merchant outsources all payment processing does not mean that the merchant won't be held responsible by their acquirer or payment brand in the event of an account data compromise.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, the merchant's acquirer or payment brand may still require the merchant to validate their PCI DSS compliance status. For example, the merchant may be required to complete SAQ A in which the merchant attests that they have outsourced all payment processing services, do not store account data, and that they are compliant with PCI DSS Requirement 12.8. PCI DSS Requirement 12.8 states that merchants must have written agreements with their service providers that include the service provider's acknowledgement of their responsibility for securing the data in their possession, and also requires that merchants monitor their service provider's compliance at least annually.<br/>

<br/>
PCI SSC intends for on-site testing to be the norm, with the majority of PCI DSS assessment testing completed at the physical client location. Though the entire PCI DSS Assessment may not require being on-site, required validation methods like ""observe"" — meaning the assessor watches an action or views something in the environment — are difficult to complete remotely. Examples of observation subjects include personnel performing a task or process, system components performing a function or responding to input, system configurations/settings, environmental conditions and physical controls.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately, the QSA is responsible for ensuring that any validation that is performed remotely is reasonably defendable, including that the remote validation is appropriate for the requirement being assessed and for each entity's particular implementation. For example, a QSA may request an onsite physical presence to observe physical security controls, attempting to ""open doors,"" etc. Similarly, in some cases a QSA might have a convincing case for relying on screen shots provided to the QSA by the assessed entity – for example, if the QSA defined the system sample themselves and then directed the assessed entity's employee to specific settings while sharing a screen via conference call. Alternative ways to meet the onsite objective could include QSAs engaging qualified local QSA resources to do onsite visits on their behalf if it is not feasible for the primary QSA to travel to the onsite location, in accordance with the QSA program requirements related to sub-contracting.  While most interviews should be conducted on-site, there may be scenarios where doing so may seem unreasonable and unnecessary. For example, it may not be reasonable for a QSA to fly to another country solely to conduct interviews on training in secure coding if the information obtained on-site at the primary and other locations describing the training is consistent with and supported by the answers provided by the employees by phone or video interview.<br/>
<br/>
The QSA is expected to be physically on-site for each PCI DSS Assessment, though the duration of the on-site visit will vary.  PCI SSC recognizes that outlier scenarios may exist where validation of individual requirements can be reasonably achieved remotely without on-site visit, but these are expected to be the exception and if such an approach is used, the QSA must be able to sufficiently document and defend why this approach was used for those individual requirements.<br/>

https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/faq/articles/Frequently_Asked_Question/what-is-the-difference-between-masking-and-truncation/,What is the difference between masking and truncation?,"Masking is addressed in PCI DSS Requirement 3.3, whereas truncation is one of several options specified to meet PCI DSS Requirement 3.4.<br/>
<br/>
Requirement 3.3 relates to protection of PAN where it is <b>displayed</b> on screens, paper receipts, printouts, etc., and is not to be confused with Requirement 3.4 for protection of PAN when <b>stored, processed, or transmitted</b> in files, databases, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Masking is a method of concealing a segment of a primary account number (PAN) when displayed or printed (for example, on paper receipts, reports, or computer screens), and is used when there is no business need to view the entire PAN.<br/>
<br/>
Truncation is a method of rendering a full PAN unreadable by removing a segment of PAN data and applies to PANs that are electronically stored (for example, in files, databases, etc.). <br/>
<br/>
Masking is not synonymous with truncation and these terms cannot be used interchangeably. Masking refers to the concealment of certain digits during display or printing, even when the entire PAN is stored on a system. This is different from truncation, in which the truncated digits are removed and cannot be retrieved within the system. Masked PAN could be 'unmasked', but there is no ""un-truncation"" without recreating the PAN from another source.<br/>
<br/>
Note that even if a PAN is masked when displayed, the full PAN might still be electronically stored and would need to be protected in accordance with PCI DSS Requirement 3.4.<br/>
<br/>
Entities should also be aware of any stricter requirements that may apply to displays of cardholder data, such as specific Payment Brand regulations and regulatory or legislative requirements —for example, restrictions for data displayed on point-of-sale (POS) receipts. PCI DSS does not supersede local or regional laws or other legislative requirements.<br/>

On the other hand, if a fax is sent or received via the Internet, it is traversing a public network and must be encrypted per PCI DSS Requirement 4.1. Any systems "" such as fax servers or workstations "" that the cardholder data passes through must be secured according to PCI DSS. Also, any cardholder data on the fax that is electronically stored must comply with PCI DSS Requirement 3.4 to render the cardholder data unreadable. If the fax system is combined with an email system (for example, via a fax-to-email gateway), the emails would also be subject to Requirement 4.2.

<br/>
""Personnel working from home"" refers to individuals that are employed by an entity to perform business duties from the individual's private residence; this does not include individuals running their own home-based business.<br/>
<br/>
A sensitive area is typically a subset of the cardholder data environment (CDE) and is any area that houses systems considered critical to the CDE. This includes data centers, server rooms, back-office rooms at retail locations, and any area that concentrates or aggregates cardholder or account data storage, processing, or transmission. Sensitive areas also include areas housing systems that manage or maintain the security of the CDE (for example, those providing network security or that manage physical or logical security).<br/>
<br/>
As a WFH environment is not considered a sensitive area, it is not expected that video cameras and/or access control mechanisms are in place to monitor or physically restrict access within these environments. Personnel working from home are expected to adhere to their organization's security policies and procedures, including limiting access to cardholder data within their  WFH environments - for example, using only company-authorized devices to access cardholder data, locking computer screens when stepping away from the computer, securing any storage of paper copies of cardholder data to prevent unauthorized access, and following the organization's policies for securing network and computer equipment used at home for work purposes.<br/>

TLS version 1.3 introduces protocol changes that may improve security and performance while removing complexities and streamlining the protocol stack. These changes, however, also introduce new considerations for organizations using TLS for security controls.<br/> <br/>Organizations implementing TLS 1.3 will need to ensure their implementation is properly configured. Factors to consider when evaluating a TLS implementation include the services and options enabled, the cryptographic algorithms supported, and the strength of the cryptographic keys used.<br/> <br/>Organizations should also be aware that the features of TLS 1.3 could affect the functionality for some types of security solutions, such as those that rely on decryption to inspect the packets before they reach the endpoint. For example, organizations using web application firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems may find that these systems no longer function as expected, as they may not be able to analyze the encrypted TLS 1.3 connections. This may require changes in the way organizations satisfy certain PCI DSS requirements.<br/> <br/>Additionally, devices that do not yet support TLS 1.3 may react differently when presented with TLS 1.3 encrypted traffic. The result could be that traffic is allowed to pass through without inspection, potentially leaving malicious payloads or activities undetected. Other devices could fallback to an earlier or insecure version of the protocol, resulting in data having a lower level of protection than intended.  These issues may result in organizations needing to reconfigure or adapt their systems so that they continue to perform as expected.<br/> <br/>As with all new technologies, organizations should evaluate and review the possible implications that TLS 1.3 may have on their environment. Organizations are encouraged to contact their security solution vendors to determine any potential impact and whether alternative configurations or other workarounds are recommended.<br/> <br/>PCI SSC continues to monitor the evolution of security protocols and their impact on security solutions for the payment industry, and will keep stakeholders informed as updates become available. "

""Firmware"" as defined in the PTS standard is ""... any code within the device that provides security protections needed to comply with (PTS) device security requirements or can impact compliance to these (PTS) security requirements. Firmware may be further segmented by code necessary to meet the PTS Core, OP (Open Protocols) or SRED (Secure Reading and Exchange of Data). Other code that exists within the device that does not provide security, and cannot impact security, is not considered firmware. Any software intended for use in a P2PE solution that does not meet the PTS definition of ""firmware"" must be assessed in accordance with the PCI P2PE standard and is subject to all applicable P2PE security requirements. Note that reassessing the PTS firmware as part of the P2PE assessment is not required nor allowed.

Compliance-accepting entities may also provide direction to their customers about which PCI DSS requirements to include in the assessment–for example, they may require that only a specific subset of PCI DSS requirements, such as those included in an SAQ, be tested and the results documented in a ROC.<br/>
<br/>
Assessors are responsible for validating that the scope of the assessment and that applicability of PCI DSS requirements is accurately defined and documented. To report a PCI DSS requirement as 'Not Applicable', the assessor must first confirm through testing that the requirement is truly not applicable to that environment. This confirmation must be performed and documented for all ""Not Applicable"" responses before a compliant result can be considered for the assessment.<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, a ""Not Tested"" response is used for assessments where a requirement (or a single aspect of a requirement) is not tested in any way – this means the requirement (or aspect thereof) is completely excluded from the assessment without any consideration as to whether it does or could apply.<br/>
<br/>
If a compliance-accepting entity directs an assessed entity or its assessor to exclude any PCI DSS requirement(s) from an assessment, that requirement(s) must be marked as 'Not Tested.'<br/>
<br/>
The <i>PCI DSS ROC Template</i> provides detailed instructions on how to properly document the findings from the testing performed, including the difference between ""Not Tested"" and ""Not Applicable"" responses.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Note that whether a ""Not Tested"" response can result in PCI DSS compliance is treated differently between PCI DSS v3.2.1 and v4.0</i>?<i>QSAs must refer to the ROC Template and the ROC Template FAQs for the version of the standard being used for relevant guidance.</i><br/>

Without proper network segmentation, the entire network is in scope for the PCI DSS. Where there are many PCs or workstations in an environment and all PCs do not need access to the cardholder data environment (CDE), the network segmentation should provide access to the CDE only for the PCs that need access, and should prohibit access for all other PCs. Where segmentation is used to reduce PCI DSS scope, the assessor must verify that the segmentation controls are effective and working as intended. The assessor would need to determine whether the connected systems provide a path for other systems into the CDE. If there are other systems on the network which are not adequately segmented (isolated) from the CDE, they could also be brought into scope. Once it has been validated that adequate segmentation is in place, PCI DSS requirements would be relevant to, and should be applied to, the PC population which is in scope. While all connected systems should be considered in scope for a PCI DSS review, the particular PCI DSS requirements applicable to each system may vary depending on the function of the system and the presence of any additional controls that are implemented. (For example, controls could be in a place that prevents the system from accessing cardholder data or from influencing the security of the CDE in any way). All such controls would need to be verified as part of PCI DSS scope verification."

For example, a more complex point-of-sale system with multiple applications and configuration options would require a greater number of PCI DSS controls than a simple payment terminal that has been locked down and secured by the manufacturer, or one that is connected via a dial-out phone line rather than connecting to a data network. <br/><br/>Merchants should ensure that they are managing their devices per the applicable PCI DSS requirements — for example, PCI DSS v4.0 Requirement 9.5 — and that any account data output from the device is suitably protected. Merchants should review the vendor documentation for their payment device to understand if the device needs additional configuration to meet PCI DSS requirements. For example, if the device is configured to output account data in clear text, the merchant will need to implement their own encryption before sending the data over the Internet.<br/><br/>Payment devices must also be reviewed during a PCI DSS assessment to confirm that they are configured properly and that the security functions and settings have not been disabled. For example, the assessor would verify that the terminal has not been configured by the merchant to store sensitive authentication data after authorization.<br/><br/>While PCI DSS does not specify the types of payment devices to be used, some payment brands require the use of PTS-approved devices.

https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/faq/articles/Frequently_Asked_Question/how-should-payment-terminals-be-considered-during-a-pci-dss-assessment/,How should payment terminals be considered during a PCI DSS assessment?,"<span>The PCI PIN Transaction Security (PTS) standards define physical and logical security requirements for different types of payment devices, including PIN-entry devices (PEDs) and other point of interaction (POI) devices. The PTS POI standard protects the PIN, which is the original objective of the PTS standard. Devices approved to PTS with SRED (Secure Reading and Exchange of Data) have additionally been assessed to provide the option to encrypt account data. PCI PTS devices with SRED, when used as part of a PCI-listed Point-to-Point Encryption (P2PE) solution, can facilitate PCI DSS scope reduction for merchants. However, for many PCI PTS devices the use of SRED is optional and this may be controlled by the payment application resident in the payment terminal. These payment applications can be expected to vary based on the merchant, terminal model, acquirer, and region/location. Therefore, unless included as part of a validated PCI P2PE Solution, or assessed against the PCI Secure Software requirements, an assessor should not assume that any payment terminal is encrypting cardholder data without further validation.</span><br/><br/><span>While use of PTS-approved payment devices can facilitate PCI DSS compliance, such devices do not by themselves guarantee PCI DSS compliance or reduce the scope of a merchant's cardholder data environment. The boundaries of the cardholder data environment are not affected by the presence or absence of a PTS-approved terminal, and any payment terminal interactions with the merchant's environment are in scope for a merchant's PCI DSS implementation. Payment terminals, regardless of whether they are validated to the PCI PTS POI standard, must be reviewed during a PCI DSS assessment to confirm that payment account data is protected during storage, processing, and transmission; either through encryption within the terminal, or by PCI DSS controls maintained across the interfacing merchant systems.</span><br/><br/><span>Often, the payment terminals will be managed by a third party (for example, the merchant's acquiring bank), and not by the assessed entity. Also, a terminal management system (TMS) may be used to manage the terminals and to update software and configurations on those payment terminals. The entity or assessor should determine if a TMS is in use, and if so, which entity is responsible for the TMS and whether the TMS is a connected-to system that needs to be included in scope for the merchant's PCI DSS assessment. The assessed entity should work with the third-party as part of its regular business-as-usual processes to maintain compliance of the payment terminals, and to prepare the appropriate evidence to demonstrate compliance with the applicable PCI DSS requirements to its assessor.</span><br/><br/><span>Assessors conducting these assessments are expected to possess sufficient knowledge and experience to conduct technically complex assessments associated with payment devices in the CDE to confirm the applicable PCI DSS requirements are met, or to work with an individual who possesses the required knowledge (for example, an entity employee, employee of a third-party managing the payment terminals, or another employee of the QSAC).</span><br/><br/><span>For all instances where payment terminals are used in the cardholder data environment (CDE), the assessor is expected to include those payment terminals in the PCI DSS assessment.

TDEA is susceptible to a known vulnerability that is currently ranked as Medium severity by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). As defined in PCI DSS Requirement 11.2.2, vulnerabilities ranked as Medium or High risk by the CVSS must be corrected and the affected systems re-scanned after the corrections to show the issue has been addressed.<br/>
<br/>
ASVs are permitted to re-rank a vulnerability's risk assignment if they disagree with the CVSS (see ASV Program Guide section 6.3.3 'Exceptions to Scoring Vulnerabilities with the NVD'), or if they are able to confirm that the risk level is lower in a particular environment. When making this type of adjustment to the scan report, the ASV should consider the scan customer's unique environment, systems, and controls, and not make adjustments based on general trends or assumptions.<br/>
<br/>
Scan customers are also permitted to dispute the scan findings if they determine a vulnerability was incorrectly reported or if compensating controls or environment-specific factors exist that reduce or eliminate the risk. Refer to ASV Program Guide sections 7.7 ""Managing False Positives and Other Disputes"" and 7.8 ""Addressing Vulnerabilities with Compensating Controls"" for details. In all cases, scan customers and ASVs should work together to determine the level of risk that a particular vulnerability may present in a specific environment or configuration.<br/>

The intent of requirements for unique user IDs and complex passwords is to ensure each user is uniquely identified ""instead of using one ID and password for several employees"" so that an organization can maintain individual accountability for actions and an effective audit trail per employee. This will help speed issue resolution and containment when misuse or malicious use occurs. Often, this requirement for unique IDs and complex passwords is met within administrative functions by using, for example, ""su"" or SSH such that the administrator initially logs on with their own unique ID and password, and then connects to the administrator account via ""su"" or SSH. Often direct root logins are disabled to prevent use of this shared administrative account. This way, individual accountability and audit trails are maintained. However, even with use of tools such as ""su"" and SSH, the actual administrator IDs and passwords should also meet PCI DSS requirements (if such accounts are not disabled) to prevent them from being misused."

The sites in other countries can only be eliminated from the scope of the primary assessment if those sites are properly segmented from the primary assessed environment. If not, a hacker compromising the sites in other countries could gain access to the primary assessed environment. If it is desirable to only include certain sites/locations in a PCI DSS review, then that should be clearly noted in the report of compliance as well as noting that specific other sites/locations were excluded from the assessment.

https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/faq/articles/Frequently_Asked_Question/do-all-pci-dss-requirements-apply-to-every-system-component/,Do all PCI DSS requirements apply to every system component?,"PCI DSS requirements apply to all system components, unless it is has been verified that a particular requirement is not applicable for a particular system.  Decisions about the applicability of PCI DSS requirements are not to be based on an entity's perception of the risk of not implementing the requirement.  Organizations may not choose which PCI DSS requirements they want to implement, and risk assessments cannot be used as a means of avoiding or bypassing applicable PCI DSS requirements.<br/>
<br/>
The applicability of specific PCI DSS requirements to a particular system may vary according to the function of that particular system.  For example, PCI DSS Requirements 3.4 - 3.6 for the secure storage of cardholder would not be applicable to systems that do not in any way store, or manage the storage of, cardholder data. It would also have to be verified that the system does not have any access to stored cardholder data, cryptographic keys, or the encryption/decryption mechanisms, in order for those requirements to be considered ""not applicable"" for that system. <br/>
<br/>
In another example, PCI DSS Requirement 2.1.1 for securing wireless technologies would not apply to a system component that was verified as not having any wireless technology.  Similarly, PCI DSS Requirements for secure firewall configurations (Requirements 1.1 - 1.3) apply to those components performing firewall functions.<br/>
<br/>
Some PCI DSS requirements may also be applied at the network level, rather than on every system.  For example, requirements for intrusion-detection and/or intrusion-prevention systems to monitor traffic in the CDE may be implemented at the network level rather than on every system in the environment.  Again, it would have to be verified by the PCI DSS assessor that the network-level control provided coverage for all systems that the requirement applies to.<br/>
<br/>
Determining that any PCI DSS requirement is not applicable to a system must be verified and supported with documented evidence. Any controls used to reduce applicability of PCI DSS requirements (for example, controls to ensure a system component cannot access cardholder data) must also be verified to be implemented properly and working as intended."
