Attestation documents, including AOCs, AOVs, and program-related attestations, that are provided by the PCI SSC require an assessor's signature.  The assessor's signature signifies the individual has knowledge, approval, and acceptance of the document's contents.  The signature should guarantee non-repudiation.  Acceptable forms of signature currently are wet signature (performed with ink) or PCI SSC-accepted electronic/digital signature (cryptographically protected, such as under the US Federal ESIGN Act, the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA), or European Union Regulation NO 910/2014 on Electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services (eIDAS)).<br/>
