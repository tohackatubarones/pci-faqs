PCI SSC does not issue an official PCI seal, mark or logo that companies can use when they achieve PCI DSS compliance. Please note that the PCI logo is a registered trademark and may not be used without authorization. You may not use the marks PCI Compliant, PCI Certified, PCI DSS Compliant, PCI DSS Certified or PCI with check marks or any other mark or logo that suggests or implies compliance or conformance with our standards. If your company is a member of one of PCI SSC's programs, i.e. PO, QSA, ASV, ISA, or QIR, please contact your Program Manager who can provide a program logo that can be used for members of that program only. Note that authorized use of an applicable PCI logo by a program member is not an indication of that organization's PCI compliance status or an endorsement by PCI SSC.
