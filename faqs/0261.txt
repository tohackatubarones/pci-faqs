Because PCI SSC does not have a contractual relationship with merchants, financial institutes, processors, etc., PCI SSC cannot be the central repository for this information. The Council's focus is to define effective payment-related security standards, as well as to educate and provide resources to the marketplace to drive awareness and adoption of these standards. The payment brands define and manage the compliance programs for these security standards, and entities will continue to send their compliance validation documentation to the payment brands, financial institutions (such as acquirers or merchant banks), or other agents, as applicable for each payment card brand compliance program.
