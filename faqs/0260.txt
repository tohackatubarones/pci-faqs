At the end of 2023, NIST disallows the use of three-key TDEA for use in protecting security sensitive data within US Federal information systems. However, as per NIST SP800-57 part 1, TDEA using three keys can still provide an effective strength of 112 bits when applied using appropriate key management and modes of operation.<br/><br/>The definition of 'strong cryptography' was updated in PCI DSS v4.0 to reference the effective key size of the algorithm/key combination rather than any specific algorithms - specifically the effective key strength is a minimum of 112 bits, with a recommendation to use systems that provide 128 bits of effective strength. Additionally, "strong cryptography" requires the use of industry-tested and accepted algorithms and proper key-management practices.<br/><br/>For other PCI SSC standards, refer to the subject standard for whether and how use of three-key TDEA is allowed.
