PCI DSS is the standard for merchants and service providers to protect cardholder data. The PA-DSS and PTS device security requirements support the overall implementation of PCI DSS by allowing merchants to choose from Council certified payment applications and PTS devices to further cardholder data security. PA-DSS and PTS are not merchant initiatives. Rather, they are geared toward the application providers and PTS device manufacturers who must submit their applications and devices for testing against the standards.
