Accounts with administrative access are those assigned with specific privileges or abilities in order for that account to manage systems, networks and/or applications. As a general rule, the functions or activities considered to be administrative are beyond those performed by regular users as part of routine business functions. For example, activities related to normal processing of card payments and providing customer service would not be considered administrative.
