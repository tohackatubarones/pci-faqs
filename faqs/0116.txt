The categories on the service provider Attestation of Compliance (AOC) are provided to assist those completing the AOC to identify their business functions as they deem appropriate and, where applicable, to categorize their services for those payment brands with service provider lists that include such categories. Because there may be different interpretations or uses of these terms in different industries or regions, PCI SSC has not provided specific definitions or criteria for these categories and each service provider is free to use them as appropriate for their particular business. If a service provider performs a function which they feel is not described in this list of categories, they may select the "Other" option, and enter the details of their service(s) in the appropriate field.<br/><br/>If a service provider is unsure whether a category could apply to their service, they should consult with the applicable payment brand.  Contact information for the payment brands can be found in FAQ # 1142 <a data-lr="1" href="/faq/articles/Frequently_Asked_Question/How-do-I-contact-the-payment-card-brands" rel="noopener" target="_blank">How do I contact the payment card brands?</a>
