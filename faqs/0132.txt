.  If a POI device that uses cellular or wireless connections is PTS-approved, and the merchant meets all the eligibility criteria for SAQ B-IP, then SAQ B-IP may be appropriate for that environment.  However, merchants should always consult with their acquirer (merchant bank) or the payment brands, as applicable, to determine if their environment is eligible for SAQ B-IP or any other SAQ. Contact details for the payment brands can be found in FAQ #1142.
