PCI DSS requirements apply wherever payment card account data is stored, processed, or transmitted. While PCI DSS does not explicitly reference the use of VoIP, VoIP traffic that contains payment card account data is in scope for applicable PCI DSS controls, just as other IP network traffic containing payment card account data would be.<br/><br/>VoIP transmissions originating from an external source and sent to an entity's environment are not considered within the entity's PCI DSS scope until the traffic reaches the entity's infrastructure. This is because an entity cannot control the method of inbound phone calls that their customers and other parties may make, including whether any payment card account data sent over that transmission is being adequately protected by the caller.<br/><br/>An entity is considered to have control over the transmission, storage and processing of VoIP traffic within their own network and up to the external perimeter of their infrastructure. The following guidance is intended to assist with PCI DSS scoping for VoIP in different scenarios.
