When a PA-DSS validated payment application has expired, it is listed as acceptable only for pre-existing deployments, or in other words, for customers that have already purchased and deployed the product.<br/>Â <br/>The PCI SSC encourages entities wishing to purchase a payment application to check the application's expiry date as part of their purchasing due diligence process. Whether, and for how long, an entity is permitted to continue using an expired application that is only "Acceptable only for Pre-Existing Deployments" is determined by the individual payment brands and/or acquirers, and should be discussed with them.
