There is a distinct difference in terms of how payment data is accepted between Direct Post &amp; iFrames/redirects, which is why there are different SAQs.  In a Direct Post implementation, the <u>merchant website produces some or all of the web page</u> that is used to accept payment data, and then passes it directly to the third-party payment processor. In this implementation, the consumer (cardholder) never leaves the merchant website.  Conversely, with a redirect or iFrame, the <u>third-party payment processor produces the webpage</u> that accepts payment data.  The merchant website is not directly involved in the acceptance of payment data as this is directly accepted by the third-party payment processor. In these implementations, the consumer leaves the merchant website and goes to the payment processor for payment acceptance and processing. <br/> <br/>This data flow is a key difference between the different methods, and is reflected in the eligibility criteria for SAQ A and SAQ A-EP as follows:
