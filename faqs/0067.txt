Each Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) was created to support a specific type of environment, depending on how the entity stores, processes, and/or transmits cardholder data. All SAQs (except for SAQ D) are intended for merchants with less complex environments, and each SAQ defines specific criteria that must be met in order to be eligible to use that SAQ. For example; SAQ B-IP is intended for environments using only PTS-approved point-of-interaction (POI) devices (excludes SCRs), SAQ C-VT for environments using only web-based virtual payment terminals on a personal computer, and SAQ C for environments using only payment application systems (for example, point-of-sale systems) connected to the Internet. In accordance with payment brand compliance programs, entities that meet all eligibility criteria for a particular SAQ may then assess and validate to the subset of PCI DSS requirements included within that SAQ.
