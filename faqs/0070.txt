Requirement 11.3.4.1 was added to PCI DSS v3.2, and requires service providers to perform penetration testing on segmentation controls at least every six months. Prior to v3.2, service providers were required to test these controls at least annually. This requirement for greater frequency of penetration testing is a best practice until January 31, 2018, after which it becomes a requirement.
