A number of industry standards bodies have transitioned away from allowing the use of SHA-1 in certain circumstances. For instance, as of December 31, 2013 the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has prohibited the use of SHA-1 for digital signatures. Likewise, members of the Certification Authority Browser Forum (CA/Browser Forum) have ceased issuing new SHA-1 certificates and will no longer trust code signed with a SHA-1 based digital signatures (effectively prohibiting the use of SHA-1 for code signing) after January 1, 2017. After this date, entities that have not upgraded their SSL/TLS certificates signed with SHA-1 based digital signatures could experience certificate errors, which could impact communications. For example: connections between browsers and websites, or connections to/from ATMs and payment terminals where digital certificates are used for authentication with a payment gateway.Â  Merchants are encouraged to contact their service providers, acquirers, and/or terminal vendors, as applicable, to update their payment terminals and websites.
