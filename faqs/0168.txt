A common example is external ASV scans, which are required at least once every three months. If an ASV scan was missed, the entity will not have sufficient ASV scan reports to provide as evidence during the assessment. Other examples include not installing a critical security patch within 30 days of release and not reviewing network security control configurations at least once every six months.
