PCI DSS does not define minimum or maximum times for which cardholder data may be stored. PCI DSS Requirement 3.1 specifies that a data retention and disposal policy must be implemented to limit data storage to that which is necessary for legal, regulatory, and/or business purposes.  It should be noted that any storage of sensitive authentication data (including full track data, card verification codes/values, and PIN block data) is prohibited after authorization per PCI DSS Requirement 3.2.<br/><br/>Whenever cardholder data is stored, it must be protected in accordance with applicable PCI DSS Requirements, including Requirements 3.4 — 3.6 (electronic storage) and 9.5 — 9.8 (storage on physical media).  Once cardholder data is no longer required, it must be securely deleted.
