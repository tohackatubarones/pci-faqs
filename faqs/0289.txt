When the Council published the Assessment Guidance for Non-listed Encryption Solutions a document containing multiple FAQs was subsequently published. This document can be retrieved <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/FAQS_Assessment_Guidance_Non-listed_Encryption_Solutions.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.<br/><br/>The aim of the Assessment Guidance for Non-listed Encryption Solutions is to provide a consistent approach for evaluating existing non-listed encryption solutions in use by merchant customers, and to reinforce that only PCI P2PE Solutions are tested and validated against the PCI P2PE Standard to provide the strongest protection for card data and reduce PCI DSS compliance responsibilities.<br/><br/>It is important to note that this is guidance only, not requirements. P2PE QSAs can use the guidance to evaluate existing solution providers' non-listed encryption solutions and document their suggested applicable PCI DSS controls for merchants that use these solutions. The aim of a non-listed encryption solution assessment is to identify the gaps between the solution and the PCI P2PE Standard and to show how use of the solution impacts a merchant's PCI DSS assessment.
