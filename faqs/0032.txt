Applications which are PA-DSS validated have been assessed by a PA-QSA as meeting all PA-DSS requirements. This means the application, when properly installed and configured, is capable of supporting the merchant's PCI DSS compliance.  <br/> <br/>	Using a PA-DSS validated application does not reduce the scope of a merchant's cardholder data environment, nor does it guarantee PCI DSS compliance. The boundaries of the cardholder data environment are not affected by the presence or absence of a PA-DSS validated payment application, and payment applications are in scope for a merchant's PCI DSS assessment. During the PCI DSS assessment, the assessor must verify that the application is implemented and configured in a PCI DSS compliant manner.  The PA-DSS Implementation Guide, provided by the application vendor for each PA-DSS validated application, is a valuable tool for the PCI DSS assessor to understand how the application is implemented and whether it is configured correctly.<br/> <br/>	Additionally, it should be noted that some payment brand rules may require the use of PA-DSS applications. Merchants should contact their acquirer or the payment brands directly, as applicable, to determine if they have any requirements.
