A payment application is a commercial application that stores, processes, or transmits cardholder data as part of authorization or settlement. A common example of a payment application is the software running on a point-of-sale (POS) terminal. For information about payment applications used in your environment, contact the application vendor. For applications installed on a POS system, the POS terminal provider or your acquirer (merchant bank) may also be able to assist.
