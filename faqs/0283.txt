While onsite assessments continue to be the expected method for PCI SSC assessments, the use of remote assessment methods may provide a suitable alternative in legitimate scenarios where an onsite assessment is not feasible. In such scenarios, entities should consult with the compliance-accepting entity to confirm whether remote assessments are allowed and any requirements they may have around performing remote assessments or the submission of remote assessment reports. <br/><br/>PCI SSC has developed a set of guidelines and procedures outlining the appropriate use of remote assessment methods when an onsite assessment is not feasible and where remote assessments are permitted by the compliance-accepting entity. The <i>PCI SSC Remote Assessment Guidelines and Procedures</i> can be found in the PCI SSC Document Library. If remote assessment methods are used in place of onsite assessment, the Assessor may be required to complete the <i>Addendum for ROC/ROV: Remote Assessments, </i>if requested by the compliance-accepting entity.
