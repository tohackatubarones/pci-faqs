<span style="color: black">P2PE solutions on the PCI list of Point-to-Point Encryption Solutions with Expired Validations are no longer considered "validated" per the P2PE Program Guide.Â  Because these P2PE solution providers did not renew their listings in accordance with PCI SSC requirements, the validations are therefore expired. <br/><br/><span style="color: black">Merchants using an expired P2PE solution should check with their acquirer or individual payment brands about their eligibility to complete SAQ P2PE.
