The P2PE Standard does not require applications solely used in a P2PE solution to be validated to PA-DSS. PA-DSS and P2PE are distinct PCI standards with separate requirements and programs, and validation against one of these standards does not imply or result in any validation against the other standard.<br/><br/>A P2PE application that is usedÂ outside a PCI-listed P2PE solution may also be subject to PA-DSS per the PA-DSS Program Guide requirements.
