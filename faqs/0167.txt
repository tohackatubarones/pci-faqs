The Prioritized Approach Tool for PCI DSS v3.2 includes an update to the built-in formulas to remove "N/A" (Not Applicable) responses from the Percent Complete calculation. Previously, a response of "N/A" was calculated in the same way as a response of "Yes" (which indicates a requirement is 'in place'). The updated calculations are statistically more accurate than previous calculations. However, as "N/A" responses are no longer calculated in the same way as "Yes" responses, this may result in a lower Overall score for non-compliant merchants than the formulas used in previous versions.
